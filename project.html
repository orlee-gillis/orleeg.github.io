        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>Cloudy is a cloud storage and organization app
with an emphasis on network collaboration and seamless integration.

Cloudy syncs with social networks and channels such as
Facebook, WhatsApp, Slack and the liking.

Users can store various file types, such as Google Drive files, Dropbox etc.

Users can access items that are stored within a range of different apps, share them with multiple groups and online communities, and collaborate with their peers and colleagues in real-time.</p>
      <div class="goal">
        <h2>The Client's Goal</h2>
        <p>Identify a ‘gap’ in the cloud storage market
Identify an audience whose cloud storage needs
are lacking the ideal tool
Research showed that the market is lacking an app that is:
Super intuitive to use
Consistent re: navigation and branding that ‘makes sense'</p>
      </div>
      <div class="role">
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>As the designer responsible for this client’s project, I was responsible for bringing life into this client’s product idea.
Through rigorous competitor research and user surveying, I came up with cloudy, a cloud storage and organization app.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <h3>The pain points at hand</h3>
        <p>Users in their 20s and 30s are longing for a space
where they can organize and store files
and collaborate seamlessly with their various social channels.

Between Facebook Groups, WhatsApp groups,
Slack channels and email lists,
there are many files to be shared
and ideas to brainstorm with each other.

Sometimes a real-time whiteboard session is called for, and generous storage space would make a big difference.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <h3>The value proposition</h3>
        <p>“Leveraging the "network effect" to generate growth.

Users will share items they've created and/or collected with their friends
and that will make their friends want to use our service too.”

Because this product will answer the specific organization,storage needs and pain points --
as voiced directly by a well-defined target audience,
the cloud storage app will appeal to its prospective users and to their like-minded networks and communities.</p>

We can identify which features would have the most added value to their pain points. </p>

																<h3>What users need</h3>
																	<p>From their very first ‘meeting’, cloudy needs to assure users that what they need to do is easy, intuitive and not confusing in any way. Not only did our user stories need to be as sharp
																		and definitive as possible, we couldn’t put our pencils down until
																		the user flows were as fool-proof as possible.</p>

																		<h2>Wireframing</h2>
																			<h3>The Blueprints of cloudy</h3>
																			<p>As we know from the process of devising a user story, there’s no time to waste when it comes to user tasks. The core layout of cloudy is what matters most. Like the user flows, we needed to have utmost clarity with what the app needs to include and how to map out the underlying user processes behind the scenes</p>

																		<h3>Ideation</h3>
																		<p>It's not just about navigation.
																			 We needed to strap on our thinking caps and really ask ourselves:</p>
																			 	<ul class="questions">
																			 		<li>How can we leverage the term ‘cloud storage’ and work with the imagery of clouds to represent our brand?</li>
																					<li>What does the name cloudy really mean?</li>
																					<li>How can we maximize the potential of visual communication?</li>
																					<li>We’re confined to the constraints of a limited drawing space, and a silent dialogue with our audience.</li>

																					<h3>Look and Feel</h3>
																					<p>Everything about the face of cloudy stems from where it all began, the design goal:
A product that is super intuitive to use and is consistent re: navigation and whose branding ‘makes sense’.

In order to achieve an intuitive, easy-to-use product, I modeled the majority of the UX and navigation inside cloudy’s dashboards and screens off of Google Drive.
Since most cloudy users will have used Google Drive, they will be familiar with this layout, so the cloudy UX should feel consistently natural, and fit them like a glove.

Brand Colors
The cloudy’s colors are blue and white, and within that several variations of blue. These represent the sky, a natural habitat for any user. Blue and white are intuitive colors for any human.

In color psychology, writes 99designs (https://99designs.com/logo-design/psychology-of-color):
“Blue appears in over half of all logos because it represents intelligence, trustworthiness and maturity. Technology companies and large corporations lean towards blue’s steadfastness and security. True blue will make sure you’re taken seriously.”

If users will be backing up/storing their documents, photos, and files in general on cloudy, they will only do so if they trust the product, and they believe their digital assets are secure. Blue is the best color to represent this experience.

Logo
The logo, logically, is a friendly, cartoon-ish yet real looking illustration of a cloud. This represents modern graphics, as cloudy is a modern SaaS product, but it also not too far fetched to what a cloud looks like in real life.

Imagery
Overall, the imagery consists of modern, upbeat looking illustrations, representing cloudy’s young audience and laid back, light feeling.

Typography
The font is Roboto, Google Material Design’s font because it is simple, clear, and looks great on both obile and desktop. And of course, it is familiar to any Google, Gmail, or Android user. </p>
	<h3>Changing in Branding Decisions</h3>
		<p>Colors
Originally, the idea was to use the three primary colors: Red, blue, and yellow. This would represent the human’s most basic color scheme, and feel natural and intuitive to all.
However, as the branding process evolved, I saw that the design of logos and other imagery would feel too heavy, and the colors wouldn’t blend well together to convey a light, intuitive feeling product.

Logo
The original logo and the final logo don’t look drastically different from eachother, as they are both illustrations of a cloud, however the styling of each one is very different.
The first one looks more primitive, as it is a basic sketch of a cloud, which in theory was thought to look more basic and natural to the user, but it didn’t actually convey the brand personality: a light, airy vibe.

Imagery
At first I liked the idea of an umbrella to represent an ‘all-encompassing’ object that captures everything you need. Yet again, although the literal connotation made sense, it didn’t convey a sense of lightness and intutition.

Typography
While Lato looked nice and straightforward, similar to the style of Roboto, Lato seemed too ‘stickler’ and formal. Roboto is the typeface used in Google Material Design, and therefore a familiar, intuitive choice.

Aesthetically, it has a less overwhelming and dominant presence on the screen.</p>

		<h3>Finding the optimal styles for the Dashboard and Doc Editor</h3>
			<p class="boxed">Dashboard</p>
				<img src="images/dashboard old.png" alt="dashboardold">
				<p>Aiming for cloudy’s functionality/navigation to use the same layout as Google Drive, I modeled the ‘Create’ and ‘Upload’ buttons off of the Google Drive Dashboard navigation.

However, my visual instinct was that they didn’t blend in to the Dashboard well, rather that they looked out of place.</p>
					<p class="boxed">Doc Editor</p>
						<img src="images/doc editor old.png" alt="doc editor old">
				<p>The ‘design dilemma’ with this screen was about the color of the menu bar.
On the one hand, it would be logical for it to be the same color as the left-column navigation menu, since they are the two menus on the screen.

Yet logic aside, when looking vertically down the doc editor, the royal blue seems to interfere with the consistent navy coloring that’s used by the search bar, doc title, style editor, and doc input. </p>

<div class="preference Testing">
	<h2>Preference Testing</h2>
		<h3>What do users think?</h3>
			<p>Even if the design and visual representation makes sense to us,
all that really matters is whether or not the users thinks so, too.
We turned to real users to tell us:</p>
<ul class="questions">
	<li>Which button makes more sense to you?</li>
	<li>Which toolbar color looks better?</li>
	<li>We're striving for perfection</li>
</ul>
			<p class="boxed">Dashboard: Version II</p>
						<img src="images/dashboard version ii.png" alt="dashboard2">
								<p>This is the alternative to the Google Drive-based navigation menu, this one uses the Android Material Styleguide’s ‘Fab’ button, which is mostly used for mobile.

I thought that this option would look more integrated into the dashboard, and familiar enough to the user that he would have an easy time understanding its purpose in the user flow.

The Fab button is a ‘unified button’. Once the user hovers over it, it expands into sub-options:</p>
						<img src="images/fab create.png" alt="fabcreate">
		<h3>What users thought about the FAB button</h3>
			<p>Aron, the user that I tested, said that although he thinks that Version 1 looks better, Option 2 is more intuitive, but it’s hard to explain why.
Aron is an Android user, so it makes sense that since he is a frequent user of the fab button, it feels intuitive to him. </p>
			<p class="boxed">Doc Editor: Version II</p>
						<img src="images/doc editor version ii.png" alt="doceditor2">
		<h3>What users thought about the Menu Bar</h3>
			<p>Miriam, the other user I tested, said it was a hard call, she thinks the navy is probably better but she’s not 100% sure.
This is a relatively subtle design decision as it isn’t connected to the UX or the navigation, rather only to the UI. In a way it is harder to finalize these decisions because the end result isn’t so critical to the success of the product. </p>

<div class="conclusion">
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Designing cloudy from A to Z was a challenging yet rewarding process.
My first time designing a full fledged product, I saw that the more difficult decisions and choices you make between design styles and directions, the more informed the final decisions are, and the more confident you are about the product you’re delivering.

It was also interesting to aim to find a middle ground between creating similar interfaces to what your target audience is used to interacting with, yet within that constraint, finding a way to differentiate the design both visually and functionally.</p>
