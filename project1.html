<h2 class="section-subtitle">Branding - cloudy comes to life</h2>
<h4 class="project-page">Ideation</h4>
<p class="section-description">It's not just about navigation. We needed to strap on our thinking caps and really ask ourselves:</p>
<ul class="user-changes">
<li>How can we leverage the term ‘cloud storage’ and work with the imagery of clouds to represent our brand?</li>
<li>What does the name cloudy really mean?</li>
<li>How can we maximize the potential of visual communication?</li>
<li>We’re confined to the constraints of a limited drawing space, and a silent dialogue with our audience.</li>
</ul>
    
<h4 class="project-page">Look and Feel</h4>
<p class="section-description">Everything about the face of cloudy stems from where it all began, the design goal:<br>
A product that is super intuitive to use and is consistent re: navigation and whose branding ‘makes sense’.<br><br>

In order to achieve an intuitive, easy-to-use product, I modeled the majority of the UX and navigation inside<br> cloudy’s dashboards and screens off of Google Drive.<br>
Since most cloudy users will have used Google Drive, they will be familiar with this layout, so the cloudy UX<br> should feel consistently natural, and fit them like a glove.<br><br>

Brand Colors<br>
The cloudy’s colors are blue and white, and within that several variations of blue. These represent the sky, a <br>natural habitat for any user. Blue and white are intuitive colors for any human.<br><br>

In color psychology, writes 99designs (https://99designs.com/logo-design/psychology-of-color):<br>
“Blue appears in over half of all logos because it represents intelligence, trustworthiness and maturity.<br> Technology companies and large corporations lean towards blue’s steadfastness and security. True blue will<br> make sure you’re taken seriously.”<br><br>

If users will be backing up/storing their documents, photos, and files in general on cloudy, they will only do so<br> if they trust the product, and they believe their digital assets are secure. Blue is the best color to represent this<br> experience.<br><br>

Logo<br>
The logo, logically, is a friendly, cartoon-ish yet real looking illustration of a cloud. This represents modern<br> graphics, as cloudy is a modern SaaS product, but it also not too far fetched to what a cloud looks like in real<br> life.<br><br>

Imagery<br>
Overall, the imagery consists of modern, upbeat looking illustrations, representing cloudy’s young audience<br> and laid back, light feeling.<br><br>

Typography<br>
The font is Roboto, Google Material Design’s font because it is simple, clear, and looks great on both mobile and<br> desktop. And of course, it is familiar to any Google, Gmail, or Android user.</p><br>
<h4 class="project-page">Changing in Branding Decisions</h4>
    <p class="section-description">Colors<br>
Originally, the idea was to use the three primary colors: Red, blue, and yellow. This would represent<br> the human’s most basic color scheme, and feel natural and intuitive to all.<br>
However, as the branding process evolved, I saw that the design of logos and other imagery would<br> feel too heavy, and the colors wouldn’t blend well together to convey a light, intuitive feeling product.<br><br>

Logo<br>
The original logo and the final logo don’t look drastically different from eachother, as they are both<br> illustrations of a cloud, however the styling of each one is very different.<br>
The first one looks more primitive, as it is a basic sketch of a cloud, which in theory was thought to<br> look more basic and natural to the user, but it didn’t actually convey the brand personality: a light,<br> airy vibe.<br><br>

Imagery<br>
At first I liked the idea of an umbrella to represent an ‘all-encompassing’ object that captures<br> everything you need. Yet again, although the literal connotation made sense,<br> it didn’t convey a sense of lightness and intutition.<br><br>

Typography<br>
While Lato looked nice and straightforward, similar to the style of Roboto, Lato seemed too ‘stickler’<br> and formal. Roboto is the typeface used in Google Material Design, and therefore a familiar, intuitive<br>choice.<br><br>

Aesthetically, it has a less overwhelming and dominant presence on the screen.</p>

<h4 class="project-page">Finding the optimal styles for the Dashboard and Doc Editor</h4>
<button class="regular" type="button">Dashboard</button>
<img src="images/dashboardold.png" class="dashboardold" alt="dashboardold">
<p class="section-description-centered">Aiming for cloudy’s functionality/navigation to use the same layout as Google Drive, I modeled the ‘Create’ and ‘Upload’ buttons off of the Google Drive Dashboard navigation.<br><br>

However, my visual instinct was that they didn’t blend in to the Dashboard well, rather that they looked out of place.</p><br>
<button class="regular" type="button">Doc Editor</button>
<img src="images/doceditorold.png" class="doceditorold" alt="doc editor old">
<p class="section-description-centered">The ‘design dilemma’ with this screen was about the color of the menu bar.<br>
On the one hand, it would be logical for it to be the same color as the left-column navigation menu, since they are the two menus on the screen.<br><br>
Yet logic aside, when looking vertically down the doc editor, the royal blue seems to interfere with the consistent navy coloring that’s used by the search bar, doc title, style editor, and doc input.</p><br><br>
</div>
<div class="preference Testing">
<h2 class="section-subtitle">Preference Testing</h2>
<h4 class="project-page">What do users think?</h4>
<p class="section-description">Even if the design and visual representation makes sense to us,<br>
all that really matters is whether or not the users thinks so, too.<br><br>
We turned to real users to tell us:</p>
<ul class="user-changes">
<li>Which button makes more sense to you?</li>
<li>Which toolbar color looks better?</li>
<li>We're striving for perfection</li>
</ul>
<button class="regular" type="button">Dashboard: Version II</button>
<img src="images/dashboardversion2.png" class="dashboardnew" alt="dashboard2">
<p class="section-description-centered">This is the alternative to the Google Drive-based navigation menu, this one uses the Android Material<br> Styleguide’s ‘Fab’ button, which is mostly used for mobile.<br><br>

I thought that this option would look more integrated into the dashboard, and familiar enough to the<br> user that he would have an easy time understanding its purpose in the user flow.<br><br>

The Fab button is a ‘unified button’. Once the user hovers over it, it expands into sub-options:</p><br>
<img src="images/fabcreate.png" class="fabcreate" alt="fabcreate">
<h4 class="project-page">What users thought about the FAB button</h4>
<p class="section-description">Aron, the user that I tested, said that although he thinks that Version 1 looks better, Option 2 is more<br> intuitive, but it’s hard to explain why.<br><br>
Aron is an Android user, so it makes sense that since he is a frequent user of the fab button, it feels<br> intuitive to him. </p>
<button class="regular" type="button">Doc Editor: Version II</button>
<img src="images/doceditorversion2png.png" class="doceditornew" alt="doceditor2">
<h4 class="project-page">What users thought about the Menu Bar</h4>
<p class="section-description">Miriam, the other user I tested, said it was a hard call, she thinks the navy is probably better but she’s<br> not 100% sure.
This is a relatively subtle design decision as it isn’t connected to the UX or the navigation, rather only<br> to the UI. In a way it is harder to finalize these decisions because the end result isn’t so critical to the success of the product. </p><br>
</div>
<div class="conclusion">
<h2 class="section-subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="section-description">Designing cloudy from A to Z was a challenging yet rewarding process.<br>
My first time designing a full fledged product, I saw that the more difficult decisions and choices you<br> make between design styles and directions, the more informed the final decisions are, and the more<br> confident you are about the product you’re delivering.<br><br>

It was also interesting to aim to find a middle ground between creating similar interfaces to what your<br> target audience is used to interacting with, yet within that constraint, finding a way to differentiate the<br> design both visually and functionally.</p>
